The program for K-means is implemented in R
R should be installed in the system.

Download :: http://cran.r-project.org/

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
>Rscript kmeans.R <dataSet>

OUT PUT:
--------

*	The 20% of input data is used as test data and 80% is used as training data
	The out put will be in the form of 2 Matrices.
		1) Centroid Matrix
		2) Classified Matrix
	In Centroid Matrix each row represents the centroids
	In Classified Matrix (with dimension cluster number x test data) 
		classified matrix[i,j] = 1 => data point "j" is in cluster "i"
		else 0.

NOTE:	The code is not optimized for machine performance, hence the program will lag for large data sets.
