Execution : Rscript fileName.R dataset.
	    Here--> 1."Rscript sampleProject.R u.data 0 0"
		    2."Rscript mainProject.R u.data 0 0"

Note:Here I included two R file(sampleProject.R,mainProject.R).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
for Excution 1."Rscript sampleProject.R u.data 0 0"
I executed this R file for only randomly 5 user which make clear visualization of Execution.I also reduced the data size for this Execution which is implicitly done in program it self, so it is fast.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
for Excution 2."Rscript mainProject.R u.data 0 0"
This is the main R file for this assignment.This program works on full "u.data" data set but it is comparatively too slow that why in include another R file.This R file each time randomly executed for 50 user.
